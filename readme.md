# Role Map - EDD Members

This is an extension of the EDD Members add-on plugin for EDD (Easy Digital Downloads).  Yes, it's an add-on for an add-on. :)

The purpose of this plugin is to build off of EDD Members' existing membership options.  It allows you to create memberships based on a given amount of time.  This plugin maps user roles to each membership option.  That way, when someone purchases a membership, their role is automatically updated.

Once a membership expires, the user's role will be switched to the default role.

You can choose the roles that can be mapped to payment options via Downloads > Settings > Extensions.

Note that this plugin only works with the variable pricing option at the moment.

**This is an early test version of the plugin.  Use at your own risk.**
